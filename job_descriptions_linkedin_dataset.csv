"About the job
Join Ember's fast-growing, global team as India embarks on its journey towards its net-zero target. This role is essential in supporting Embers work on establishing an understanding of methane emissions from coal mining in India and the opportunities for reducing these. Were committed to providing a great place to work at a competitive salary. We invest in our staff, offer flexible working conditions and pride ourselves on being an open and collaborative workplace. Were a friendly and supportive team, and all passionately committed to addressing the climate crisis.

Ember is an independent energy and climate think tank, with a mission to shift the world to Clean Electricity using data. We gather, curate, analyse and use data to advocate policies that help drive down emissions from electricity generation and accelerate transition to clean power.

A significant barrier to Indias transition to clean power is high dependence on fossil fuels for electricity generation, wherein coal is the highest contributor. This means that the coal industry plays a critical role in both the energy and climate challenge. India is currently the fourth largest emitter of methane from coal mining, but these emissions remain unmonitored. Methane is the 2nd biggest contributor to global warming with shorter atmospheric lifetime but stronger potency and warming potential. This Coal Mine Methane (CMM) is set to grow significantly, unless, of course, intervened.

As highlighted by the IPCC and IEA, addressing Coal Mine Methane is also one of the most cost-effective emissions reduction strategies in the short term.

Ember has already made a major international impact in drawing attention to the methane crisis in Australia and the European Union. Please read more about our work here: https://ember-climate.org/topics/coal-mine-methane

Ember sees an opportunity in India to utilise our approach to critical data analysis to evaluate the impact of coal mine methane and reduce the climate impact of the coal sector. With India planning to ramp up coal mining by 2030, there is a crucial window to shine the light on the issue and the opportunities to abate these emissions, especially as technology already exists to do so.

Ember is looking for a passionate Senior Analyst to lead Ember's Coal Mine Methane (CMM) activities in India, with support from our existing CMM team based in Europe, Australia and Indonesia.

To apply you do not need specific expertise in mining or coal mine methane, but a broad understanding of the climate and energy landscape and an appetite to work with many different stakeholders.

The successful candidate will have:
 Adequate capacity to research and source national data on methane emissions to support our efforts to reduce emissions in India.
 A deep understanding of climate and energy topics,
 A good sense of the related developments in the country,
 A strong network in government and may also have relationships with international and Indian NGOs

Location

This is a remote post, but you would need to be based in India, ideally in Delhi. Occasional travel within India might also be necessary.

Key Responsibilities
Lead Embers research on Indias coal mine methane (CMM) emissions to better understand the challenges and opportunities
Gather data that can be analysed and used to tell a story of the significance of methane in Indias coal mining sector
Use data and research to write op-eds and reports that grab attention with the right players 
Collaborate with Embers existing team in India and build relationships with research institutes, think tanks and government organisations 
Lead on developing a strategy for how to raise the priority of CMM and how to realise the opportunities in improving the monitoring and capture of CMM.
Align our CMM work with the wider energy transition in India 
Brief government and NGO contacts on CMM opportunities and lead workshops/ webinars and panel discussion to improve awareness
Use understanding of the policy landscape to identify opportunities and tipping points where we might shift the narrative and have an impact on CMM 

Requirements

We are especially keen to encourage applications from people underrepresented in climate change analysis and campaigning. Climate change is a race issue, a class issue, and a gender issue. We welcome applicants with lived experiences of these issues.

Must have
Ability to research and source coal mining emissions data and curate datasets
Minimum five (5) years working in relevant Senior research, analyst or policy positions for a climate think tank, NGO, academia or private sector organisation working in India (background in the mining industry also welcomed);
An effective networker with an established network in Indias energy and coal space 
Knowledge of the coal sector in India and where this fits with climate, energy and environmental politics and experience in developing strategies to influence policy 
Able to work independently and effectively in spoken and written English, such as writing articles and reports without supervision. 
Passionate about reducing global greenhouse gas emissions
Confident working remotely with a broad range of people, from different countries and timezones.

Nice to have
Experience of working with anthropogenic methane emissions (coal, oil, gas, agriculture, biogas)
Experience of developing policy or campaigning in the policy field
Contacts in relevant government organisations and experience liaising with key government ministries and organisations working on coal mining
Communications/outreach experience to communicate complex ideas succinctly and to influence climate narratives
Proficiency in Hindi 
Fascination with data and data visualisation

Benefits

Salary: Competitive

Contract: Full time (but only working 9 days every fortnight with no reduction in pay), permanent subject to a 3 month probationary period.

Further benefits: We offer a competitive benefits package, including:
We operate a nine-day fortnight meaning our full-time staff are given every other Friday off work with no reduction in pay
25 days holiday, plus UK bank holidays (unless local statutory minimums are higher)
For each year that you're part of the team at Ember you'll receive an additional day of holiday, up to a maximum of 5 additional days. 
Generous paid maternity and paternity leave
Flexible working conditions, including the opportunity for part-time work and home working.
Access to a counselling service
Funding and allocated time for your training and development
